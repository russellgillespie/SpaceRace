# SpaceRace
_**A tabletop game of interplanetary conquest!**_



## How to Play



### Objecive: Take over all the planets in the galaxy!


### Elements

* GALACTIC MAP
* SPACESHIPS
* PLANETS
* MOTHERSHIPS
* HOMEWORLD
* STARWAYS
* TREASURE

#### SPACESHIPS

These are the core of the game. Made up of a Defense, Movement, and Attack Score (henceforth [D|M|A]). These ships will do battle throughout the galaxy. Capture and upgrade ships to build your fleet and strengthen your position on the Galactic Map!

#### MOTHERSHIPS

This is heart of your fleet. You start with a Mothership template and distribute [10] points across the ship's [D|M|A] counters. Assign these strategically, as they form the basis of your assault on the map. But careful! If your Mothership gest destroyed, you will need to rebuild it on your HOMEWORLD.

#### PLANETS

Move around the map with your SPACESHIPS to discover new planets or conquer ones held by your opponents! Taking planets is simple; just move your ship onto a planet and, if it is unoccupied, it is now part of yoru colonies. If not.... (See Space Battles p.2)

#### STARWAYS

STARWAYS connect each planet and contain 4 tiles each. They are marked with TREASURE [T] or STARSHIPS [S] representing random encounters in space flight. Defeat marauding ships to build your fleet, or find unexpected equipment in abandoned cargo holds!

#### TREASURE

These [T] cards contain upgrades (and potentially downgrades!) to your ships. Find and equip these by taking PLANETS, landing on [T] Tiles, or -SPACE BATTLES!-


### SPACE BATTLES

#### OVERVIEW:

SPACE BATTLES are the core of Space Race. Three types of SPACE BATTLES occur when tow or more SPACESHIPS occupy the same space.

* PLAYER vs MAP
* PLAYER vs PLAYER
* PLANETARY ASSAULT

#### PLAYER vs MAP:

When a PLAYER's SPACESHIP moves onto an [S] tile, draw a SPACESHIP [S] card. Turn the cards so their [D|M|A] squares face each other. The card with the highest [M] score goes first, comparing its [A] score against the opponent's [D] score. If the defending ship survives, repeat the process by using the remaining [A] and [D] scores.
