# SpaceRace
_**A tabletop game of interplanetary conquest!**_



## How to Play



### Objecive: Take over all the planets in the galaxy!


### Elements

* GALACTIC MAP
* NEXUS
* SPACESHIPS
* PLANETS
* MOTHERSHIPS
* HOMEWORLD
* STARWAYS
* TREASURE

#### GALACTIC MAP

The GALACTIC MAP is the result of laying out all the various NEXUS, PLANET, and STARWAY tokens and forms both the framework for navigaion and the object of the game.

#### NEXUS

The NEXUS sits at the center of the board connecting disparate parts of the GALACTIC MAP with each other in a more direct path. Moving a SPACESHIP through the NEXUS requires a one turn delay as the vehicle and its inhabitants pass through customs and refueling operations.

#### SPACESHIPS

These are the core of the game. Made up of a Defense, Movement, and Attack Score (henceforth [D|M|A]). These ships will do battle throughout the galaxy. Capture and upgrade ships to build your fleet and strengthen your position on the Galactic Map!

#### MOTHERSHIPS

This is heart of your fleet. You start with a Mothership template and distribute [10] points across the ship's [D|M|A] counters. Assign these strategically, as they form the basis of your assault on the map. But careful! If your Mothership gest destroyed, you will need to rebuild it on your HOMEWORLD.

#### PLANETS

Move around the map with your SPACESHIPS to discover new planets or conquer ones held by your opponents! Taking planets is simple; just move your ship onto a planet and, if it is unoccupied, it is now part of yoru colonies. If not.... (See Space Battles p.2)

#### STARWAYS

STARWAYS connect each planet and contain 4 tiles each. They are marked with TREASURE [T] or STARSHIPS [S] representing random encounters in space flight. Defeat marauding ships to build your fleet, or find unexpected equipment in abandoned cargo holds!

#### TREASURE

These [T] cards contain upgrades (and potentially downgrades!) to your ships. Find and equip these by taking PLANETS, landing on [T] Tiles, or -SPACE BATTLES!-


### SPACE BATTLES

#### OVERVIEW:

SPACE BATTLES are the core of Space Race. Three types of SPACE BATTLES occur when tow or more SPACESHIPS occupy the same space.

* PLAYER vs MAP
* PLAYER vs PLAYER
* PLANETARY ASSAULT

#### PLAYER vs MAP:

When a PLAYER's SPACESHIP moves onto an [S] tile, draw a SPACESHIP [S] card. Turn the cards so their [D|M|A] squares face each other. The card with the highest [M] score goes first, comparing its [A] score against the opponent's [D] score. If the defending ship survives, repeat the process by using the remaining [A] and [D] scores.

#### STANDOFFS

A STANDOFF occurs if there is no clear winner in a SPACE BATTLE. In this case, the PLAYER may choose to make a contested roll with 1d6, or may choose to flee if their ship has a higher [M] score. If contested, roll 1d6 for each SPACESHIP. The highest number wins. In the case of a tie, reroll until a winner is determined.

#### PLAYER vs PLAYER

PLAYER vs PLAYER (PvP) combat is similar, but introduces a few competitive mechanics. When players engaged in a SPACE BATTLE have matching [M] scores, they will contest who gains the initiative by each rolling 1d6, once again with the highest roll winning and rerolling any ties. There is also an added bonus for winning; see VICTORY!

#### PLANETARY ASSAULT

PLANETARY ASSAULT occurs when a PLAYER's SPACESHIP lands on another PLAYER's PLANET that is fortified by one or more defending SPACESHIPS orbiting the PLANET. In PLANETARY ASSAULT, the defending SPACESHIP's [M] score is set to 0 and its [D] score is _doubled_. Great rewards await those who are victorious in PLANETARY ASSAULT!

### VICTORY!

#### PvM

You acquire a new SPACESHIP! Capture and name the ship you have just defeated.

#### PvP

ASSIMILATE or DESTROY! 
Choose 1: 
* ASSIMILATE the defeated SPACESHIP into your fleet
* DESTROY the defeated SPACESHIP and take its upgrades (and downgrades) on board!

#### PLANETARY ASSAULT

The rewards for PLANETARY ASSAULT follow the same rules as PvP but additionally make a PLANETARY CONQUEST roll...

#### PLANETARY CONQUEST

Congratulations! You have discovered (or conquered) a new PLANET!

Make a 1d6 roll and draw TREASURE cards based on one half the result rounded down.

|Roll|1|2|3|4|5|6|
|----|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| [T]|0|1|1|2|2|3|

### DEFEAT...

#### PvM

If defeated in a PvM battle, your SPACESHIP is destroyed. Return it aned all [T] cards to their respective piles and shuffle.

#### MOTEHRSHIP

If your MOTHERSHIP is destroyed, return it to your HOMEWORLD to be rebuilt. Roll 1d6 on each subsequent turn and add the number of PLANETS you control to the score. If it totals 6 or above, your MOTHERSHIP has been rebuilt successfully and may move on your next turn!

<hr>

### SETUP

1. Lay out the NEXUS token in the center of the board. 
2. Surround it with as many PLANETS as there are PLAYERS. 
3. Build outward by attaching STARWAYS and PLANETS alternately; these patterns should match. 
4. Use remaining PLANETS and STARWAYS by attaching them to the nexus similarly. 
5. PLAYERS choose a PLANET to be their HOMEWORLD by each rolling 1d6 to determine the order of choice. 
6. Each player in turn chooses a PLANET and the last PLAYER to choose their HOMEWORLD starts the game.

### GAME SYSTEM and TOKENS

##### A Note On Balance and Creativity

These numeric distributions should be experimented with freely to adjust to any play group's desired style. This is also reflected in the Blank Image and Name frames on the TREASURE, SPACESHIP, and PLANET cards. One of the great joys of SPACE RACE is that feeling of exploration and naming your finds and acquisitions along the way. Add some art during that _slow guy's_ turn! Make your HOMEWORLD and SPACESHIPS an expression of yourself... just careful not to become too attached, lest you run into a hostile PLAYER out there on the STARWAYS!
#### SPACESHIP

**Layout**

[D|M|A]: 3 Labeled Number Boxes
Image: Blank 2D Canvas
Name: Blank Text Box

Card and Attribute Distribution:

The SPACESHIP deck can consist of an array of cards given an average of 10 points distributed across its [D|M|A]. In the standard set, a standard deviation curve has been applied to the various SPACESHIP cards to present an even, yet variable power curve. This assists in making the early game possible to navigate while still providing a cautionary device to unbridled exploration.

#### TREASURE

**Layout**

[D|M|A]: 3 Labeled Number Boxes
Image: Blank 2D Canvas
Name: Blank Text Box 

Card and Attribute Distribution:

The TREASURE deck follows a similar standard distribution framework, but is applied to a smaller range of upgrades and downgrades available for PLAYERS to encounter. A typical upgrade might add +1-3 to any one of the [D|M|A] scores of the SPACESHIP to which it is affixes. The range of downgrades or disasters that might affect a SPACESHIP should be roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of the total of cards in the TREASURE deck with scores ranging in the negatives from -1 to -2 and perhaps the occasional bogeyman 3. 

#### STARWAYS

**Layout**

[?|?|?|?]: 4 Blank Text Boxes

Card and Attribute Distribution:

The STARWAYS cards make up the navigation system of SPACE RACE. These cards should be assigned in accordance with the standard deviation framework mentioned above to include a variety of [T] and [S] squares in various densities throughout the deck. There should be good balance of safe or mundane spaces mixed in with the encounters to vary the gameplay pattern satisfactorily.

#### NEXUS

**Layout**

(O): 2 Concentric Circles

There is only one NEXUS. Feel free to decorate it however you like. It's a magical place.
